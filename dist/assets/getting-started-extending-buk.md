# Extending Bük

Bük being open source, feel free to fork it and make it your own!  
Built using [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) with the [webpack-simple](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack-simple) template, running a local version of Bük is incredibly easy:
```
    cd buk
    npm install
    npm run dev     // Serving on localhost:8080 by default
    
    npm run build   // To generate a minified production ready script.
```

Please refer to [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) documentation for further customization.
