# Write your own pages

Bük will be able to render any valid markdown file thanks to its underlying parser.

#### Markdown cheatsheet
If you need references on writing mardown files, please refer to the following list of resources:

#### Markdown editor

Bük 1.0 is not shipping with an integrated markdown editor yet.  
If you need a markdown editor, [dillinger.io](http://dillinger.io/#) would be a favorite of mine.
